        The Gregory Archive consists of a large quantity of audio visual material gathered over a period of nearly six decades across a large number of locations throughout the world. A subset of this collection, presented here, includes nearly 25,000 individually mounted color positive slides, which have been stored in metal slide file boxes according to a system devised by Timothy Gregory.

        Most often, these boxes are organized geographically (e.g. Venice, Monevasia, Saqqara), but they are also occasionally sorted by material (e.g. Coins, Byzantine Pottery, Ikons) or according to Gregory's research / teaching activities (e.g. Isthmia 96, APKAS, Study Tour 1985).

        Because of the quantity of this material, the Gregory Archive has decided to privilege speed and efficiency over quality of images so that the collection can be presented in its entirety in a timely fashion. To that end, the following process has been adopted.

        A Nikon D60 and variable zoom lens with a focal length of 32mm has been mounted to a standard copy stand. A thin LED panel with a white plexiglass diffuser serves as the stage for the slides. This provides even backlight for the film image, while ambient light illuminates the paper or plastic mount, which often contains Gregory's notes and other information. Each slide is photographed individually.
