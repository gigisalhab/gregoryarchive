        Upon his retirement from the Ohio State University, Timothy Gregory placed his personal research archive in the care of Michigan State University. This important collection of publications, lectures, field notes and other forms of archaeological documentation generated over six decades of research and teaching, has now become the <strong>Gregory Archive</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important part of this archive, and the first to be digitized and shared publicly, is an impressive collection of 35mm color slides that Gregory individually labeled and stored in metal filing cases according to location or subject.
      </p>

        As those who know him are well aware, Gregory was an accomplished photographer. From the time of his earliest visits to Europe to his archaeological work at excavations and surveys to trips among the various cities he calls home, he was never without a camera.

        We hope that these images might be useful for research purposes as well as the simple delight of seeing the world from Gregory's point of view. For a quick preview of images we think are particularly interesting, see the 
        <a href="#">Featured Images</a> page.
